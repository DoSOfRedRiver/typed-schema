# Welcome to Typed Schema
Typed schema is an http service definition DSL, currently translating to [akka-http Routes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/routing-dsl/overview.html) and [OpenApi 3.0 definition](https://swagger.io/specification/) inspired by the [haskell-servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

To learn more about TypedSchema see [Getting Started](getting_started.html).
